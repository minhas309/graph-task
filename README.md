Let's imagine you're in a cool master's program and you get to go to different countries each semester.

This task is all about creating a cool website that shows where everyone is going. You have to make it look awesome and easy to understand.

Imagine you have 20 classmates, and each one has a different track.

The first country you go to is always Norway, it's fixed. Then, for the second and third semesters, you have some choices. You can either go to Spain or France in the second semester and in the third semester, you can go to either Finland or back to Norway.

For example, Adam might go to Norway, then Spain, and then Norway.  
Eva could go to Norway, then France, and then Finland.

The task is to make a graph or chart that shows these tracks in a fun and clear way. You can even make different types of graphs to show the same information but in different ways.

It's all about being creative and making it look cool.

Title: Visualization of Mobility Tracks

Mobility Combinations:

-   Norway -\> Spain -\> Norway
    -   Norway -\> Spain -\> Finland
    -   Norway -\> France -\> Norway
    -   Norway -\> France -\> Finland

Class Size: x students

Requirements:

-   Create a visually appealing website to display the mobility tracks.
-   Use categories or graphs to present the information clearly.
-   Consider using various types of graphs (e.g., chart graph, connected graph) to showcase the same information in different ways.
-   Ensure the visualization is cool and effective, allowing easy identification of each student's track.

Process:

-   Checkout project
-   Make branch
-   Switch to branch
-   Develop Stuff - see issues
-   Raise PR

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
