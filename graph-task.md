Let's imagine you're in a cool master's program and you get to go to different countries each semester.

This task is all about creating a cool website that shows where everyone is going. You have to make it look awesome and easy to understand.

Imagine you have 20 classmates, and each one has a different track.

The first country you go to is always Norway, it's fixed. Then, for the second and third semesters, you have some choices. You can either go to Spain or France in the second semester and in the third semester, you can go to either Finland or back to Norway.

For example, Adam might go to Norway, then Spain, and then Norway.  
Eva could go to Norway, then France, and then Finland.

The task is to make a graph or chart that shows these tracks in a fun and clear way. You can even make different types of graphs to show the same information but in different ways.

It's all about being creative and making it look cool.

Title: Visualization of Mobility Tracks

Mobility Combinations:

-   Norway -\> Spain -\> Norway
    -   Norway -\> Spain -\> Finland
    -   Norway -\> France -\> Norway
    -   Norway -\> France -\> Finland

Class Size: x students

Requirements:

-   Create a visually appealing website to display the mobility tracks.
-   Use categories or graphs to present the information clearly.
-   Consider using various types of graphs (e.g., chart graph, connected graph) to showcase the same information in different ways.
-   Ensure the visualization is cool and effective, allowing easy identification of each student's track.

Process:

-   Checkout project
-   Make branch
-   Switch to branch
-   Develop Stuff - see issues
-   Raise PR
